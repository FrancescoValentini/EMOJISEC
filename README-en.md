# üîê EMOJISEC
[üáÆüáπ Italian Version](README.md)

**EMOJISEC** is a web app that allows you to encrypt messages using the **AES-256-GCM** algorithm.

The 256-bit key is derived from the password provided by the user via **PBKDF2**.

The ciphertext can be encoded in **Base64** or using a custom encoding where each byte (0‚Äì255) is mapped to an emoji.

> [!WARNING]
> The encryption key (256 bits) is derived from the user‚Äôs password using **PBKDF2**, which provides high resistance to brute-force attacks.
> However, overall security depends on the strength of the chosen password: weak passwords can compromise the protection of the encrypted text.

## üîß Usage
The app can be used directly online, saved locally, or installed as a PWA.

**To encrypt a message:**
1. Enter your password.
2. *(Optional)* Choose the encoding: EMOJI (default) or Base64.
3. Type your message.
4. Press **Encrypt** ‚Äî the ciphertext will replace the plaintext.

**To decrypt a message:**

1. Enter your password.
2. Paste the ciphertext.
3. *(Default: emoji)* Select the correct encoding of the ciphertext.
4. Press **Decrypt** ‚Äî the plaintext will replace the ciphertext.
